                    Hi, I’m Courage aka MrYande, I’m excited to be part of the Altschool Africa School of Engineering
                    program.
                    I have a deep passion for technology and problem-solving, and I see this as the perfect opportunity
                    to refine my skills and make a meaningful difference. I bring a results-driven mindset and a diverse
                    background in business management, sales, design, and professional writing. My goal is to use my
                    expertise to foster growth and contribute significantly to the success of any organization I work with.

            <p>
                My goal is to become a top full-stack developer by mastering both
                front-end and back-end tracks. I aim to collaborate on innovative projects that make a real impact

                world. I aspire to be among the best in the field and grow into a leadership role where I can
                inspire and guide others in the tech industry.
