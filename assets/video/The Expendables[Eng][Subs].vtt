WEBVTT

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:03.529
Don't shoot me.

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:05.595
Who is that?

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:08.668
There's your money. Release the hostages.

00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:09.742
How much in there?

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:10.831
Three.

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:13.537
You're too late. We want $5 million.

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:19.915
What do you know? A greedy pirate.

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:22.488
Last chance!

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.356
Take it or leave it.

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:26.854
We want the money now!

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:29.692
-Warning shot.
-No!

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:35.666
A little low.

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:42.834
Lights out!

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:16.131
l'll kill him! l swear l'll kill him!

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:24.638
Drop your guns!

00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:25.740
Fat chance.

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:26.976
Yeah, that'll happen.

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:29.748
Last chance. Let the hostages go

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.182
or you're out of there.

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:34.689
Bring the money here to me.

00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:36.622
l'll take the four on the left.

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.788
l want you to take the two on the right.
Leave the rest alone.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:43.194
l'll kill them all! l don't care.

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:46.233
You should take the two on the right.
You're not that fast anymore.

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:48.030
The only thing faster is lightning.

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:50.743
We'll see.

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:54.879
Bullets go faster than blades.

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:57.645
Bring the money here now!

00:06:57.917 --> 00:06:58.884
You want the money?

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:02.918
Go get it.

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:07.983
What's that?

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:09.425
l'm getting a text.

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:10.829
Excuse me?

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:12.164
Kill them!

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.304
-l call that a tie.
-Come on, keep dreaming.

00:07:21.707 --> 00:07:23.971
These guys are arrested development.

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:25.737
A little compassion, folks.

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:27.309
You know, l don't think
you hit one of them.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.380
l don't see any knives, actually.

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:30.849
How are you guys doing?

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:35.249
-What the hell is he doing?
-Hanging a pirate.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.116
Don't be ridiculous.

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:40.554
Gunner! What are you doing?

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:42.656
Hanging a pirate!

00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:45.896
-That is seriously demented.
-This is no good.

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:48.265
-You're on your own.
-Appreciate it.

00:07:48.367 --> 00:07:49.766
lt's good to have friends.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.527
-Gunner.
-Yeah?

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.832
This isn't how we work. Let him go.

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:55.835
Why? He'd do it to us.

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:57.603
Gunner, last chance.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.541
Let him go or we're letting you go.

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.139
lt's good to hang pirates.

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:22.325
-We don't kill like that.
-Yeah?

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:24.429
Not polite enough?

00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:27.536
-Let him go, Gunner.
-How are you doing, Barney?

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:28.998
Pretty good.

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:31.172
My partner here kicked me
with steel-tipped boots.

00:08:31.277 --> 00:08:33.108
-Can you believe that?
-You deserved it.

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:34.771
l think l'll need stitches.

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:35.870
Maybe.

00:08:36.315 --> 00:08:38.715
-l hate stitches.
-Everyone does.

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:40.780
Let him go, Gunner.

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:41.945
Let him go?

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:44.246
Let him go.

00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:24.627
-Think he's cool?
-Be careful. Go.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.938
Gunner, you cool?

00:09:45.184 --> 00:09:46.242
Yeah.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.495
No, keep it.

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:02.160
You appreciate a good blade.

00:10:16.182 --> 00:10:17.171
He all right?

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.250
Yeah.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.253
The life just got to him.

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:24.254
lt'll get to all of us.

00:10:59.025 --> 00:10:59.992
Coming!

00:11:03.429 --> 00:11:04.453
Who is it?

00:11:04.563 --> 00:11:08.090
Someday you'll find a man
who'll be happy just to watch you sleep.

00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:15.506
-Hi. l didn't know you were back.
-Hey, babe.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.439
Yeah, l just arrived.

00:11:18.544 --> 00:11:20.444
-Hey.
-You look great.

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.444
l wish you would have called.

00:11:23.549 --> 00:11:25.881
l've never been a good caller.

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:28.384
l haven't heard from you in over a month.

00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:30.751
Really? Time flies, huh?

00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:33.482
Won't happen again! Sorry.

00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:36.794
But l do have a surprise.

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:39.657
Rose-flavored. Your favorite.

00:11:42.802 --> 00:11:45.236
And l did have something else for you.

00:11:46.505 --> 00:11:50.874
lt's something l picked up from Burma.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.675
lt's a ruby.

00:11:54.647 --> 00:11:58.014
lt's a good color,
but it's hard to see in this light.

00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:03.048
This kind of looked a little shinier
when l bought it in the shop, you know?

00:12:03.155 --> 00:12:05.419
Lace, everything all right?

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:11.090
-Yeah.
-Who is he?

00:12:13.365 --> 00:12:14.389
He's a friend.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.593
Kind of late. You got a name?

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.730
Friend. She just told you.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:25.402
Lee, come on.

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:27.771
Don't leave like this. Lee, l'm sorry.

00:12:28.814 --> 00:12:30.008
l thought things were good between us.

00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:33.483
l felt like you never cared about getting
in my life or letting me into yours.

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.110
-Stop.
-Yeah, sure l did.

00:12:35.221 --> 00:12:37.951
No.
l have known you for over a year and a half,

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:39.888
and l don't even know
what you do for a living.

00:12:39.992 --> 00:12:42.654
What's it matter?
When l'm here, l'm with you. That matters.

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:46.163
What matters is when you're here,
you're not really here.

00:12:46.665 --> 00:12:48.360
You're a good man. l love you, but.. .

00:12:48.467 --> 00:12:50.196
-Lace!
-l hate his voice.

00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:52.831
-Did you say something?
-Don't let him come down here.

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:54.504
Please tell me you understand
what l'm saying.

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:56.939
-You have to understand.
-l understand.

00:12:57.209 --> 00:12:58.176
You take care.

00:12:58.277 --> 00:12:59.505
Lee.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:05.878
He's no good, Lace.

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:48.558
Hey, brother, don't you ever sleep?

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.364
This is my friend.. .

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:56.123
What's your name again, baby?

00:13:56.235 --> 00:13:57.259
-Cheyenne.
-Cheyenne.

00:13:57.536 --> 00:13:59.595
Cheyenne, Arapaho, Cherokee, Pawnee.

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:01.640
You want a drink?

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:03.536
l'm good.

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:06.235
Why don't you run upstairs

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:10.611
and get me one of them
super-duper six-olive martinis, baby?

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:12.239
-Anything for you, baby.
-You got it.

00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:16.851
-Got a crush on me.
-Like the last 50.

00:14:16.956 --> 00:14:18.480
Hey, brother, who's counting?

00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:21.185
-Damn, you look good.
-Look at you.

00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:23.261
You look like a goddamn
cold piece of steel, brother.

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:27.628
Yeah, well.
Okay, my friend, let's finish this bird up.

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:31.728
Well, let's do it, bro. lt's taken you
a couple of years to do a couple of letters.

00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:37.700
We had to get rid of Gunner.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:41.373
Well, he went Crankenstein on your ass.
You got to cut him loose.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.243
You wanna fill in?

00:14:43.349 --> 00:14:44.509
Let me tell you something.

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:46.448
Remember where we was last time?

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:48.679
Where were we?
We were ass-deep in that mud and blood.

00:14:48.787 --> 00:14:51.779
-Nigeria.
-Yeah, your hand was all shot to shit.

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:55.191
You were bleeding all over the place,
and l was bleeding,

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.556
and you know what l did?
l promised myself,

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:02.690
l don't wanna die all alone,
full of holes in the mud and blood.

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:06.036
l'm gonna die with something that counts.
l'm gonna die with a woman.

00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:09.469
l wanna die with someone
who cares about me, you know.

00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:11.566
l don't wanna die for a woman.

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:13.668
l wanna die laying next to a woman.
That's what l want.

00:15:16.715 --> 00:15:18.979
-lt's Christmastime.
-Yeah, l can smell him from here.

00:15:24.657 --> 00:15:26.818
Mr. Christmas. How you doing, brother?

00:15:27.393 --> 00:15:28.860
l'm good, Tool.

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:31.157
Take a look at this. What do you think?

00:15:31.463 --> 00:15:33.260
lt still looks like a black chicken.

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:35.196
-Black chicken?
-Black chicken? You done?

00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:38.465
-All done.
-lt's a damn raven.

00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:42.366
Man. lt's good to see you, brother.

00:15:43.976 --> 00:15:45.671
Wow! You know what?

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:49.708
For you, l got a great idea.

00:15:50.482 --> 00:15:53.474
Why don't you let me doodle, like, a.. .

00:15:53.585 --> 00:15:56.645
l don't know, Charlotte's web on your head?

00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:58.354
On the top of your head.

00:15:58.757 --> 00:16:00.349
You know, something different,
something exciting.

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:03.292
'Cause you got one of them
perfectly-shaped domed, muscular heads.

00:16:03.662 --> 00:16:07.359
l could put a web on the top of the head.

00:16:08.033 --> 00:16:10.763
Maybe a pregnant Charlotte
coming out of your ear,

00:16:10.869 --> 00:16:14.464
peeking around,
making sure them bugs don't come inside.

00:16:14.573 --> 00:16:16.598
Her long leg dangling down your neck.

00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:19.368
-Yeah. Sexy, right?
-Very sexy.

00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:22.375
Give you a little mystery,
a little more character.

00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:24.711
And very sexy. You understand?

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:26.341
lt makes him stand out.

00:16:27.753 --> 00:16:28.777
He looks thrilled.

00:16:28.887 --> 00:16:32.653
Well. Okay, l'll tell you what.
l'm feeling a little lucky tonight.

00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:35.418
l'm feeling very accurate.

00:16:35.594 --> 00:16:38.290
-Another time. Come on.
-Come on, take him on.

00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:40.293
Come on, Christmas. Bring it, baby.

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:41.730
Don't encourage him, please.

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:43.034
He never beat you in your life.

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:45.569
Come on, Christmas, no disgrace in losing.

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:05.116
Yes?

00:17:09.361 --> 00:17:10.419
Yeah.

00:17:12.498 --> 00:17:13.556
Okay.

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:18.393
Well, l got three pieces of work.

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:23.070
Two a walk in the park,
and one to hell and back.

00:17:23.475 --> 00:17:26.103
-l need some time alone.
-Hey, cheer up. Make the meeting.

00:19:04.743 --> 00:19:06.836
Now we can see inside of him.

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:09.474
And l see lies.

00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:14.712
He wasn't stealing from you.
He was stealing from us both.

00:19:16.388 --> 00:19:19.516
You want your apes' respect?
Snuff those two.

00:19:33.105 --> 00:19:34.367
Let's just keep it simple.

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:36.907
lf the money's right,
we don't care where the job is.

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:38.977
-Got it?
-Let's quit jerking off,

00:19:39.077 --> 00:19:40.874
get down to business, see who's hungry.

00:19:40.979 --> 00:19:43.880
l know your real name's
probably not Barney Ross.

00:19:43.982 --> 00:19:45.847
You don't need to know my name.

00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:49.352
The only thing you need to know is
the job's real and the money's real.

00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:51.945
But since we're in this nice place,

00:19:53.158 --> 00:19:55.353
you might as well just call me Mr. Church.

00:19:56.328 --> 00:19:58.193
Okay, Church. What can l do for you?

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.697
ln a minute.
l'm still waiting for one more guy.

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:03.161
Who?

00:20:14.479 --> 00:20:15.673
You know him?

00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:17.681
Yeah, we used to be
on the same team together.

00:20:18.116 --> 00:20:19.947
What's my oldest, worst friend doing here?

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:22.981
Both of your names came
to the top of the list.

00:20:23.088 --> 00:20:24.953
-ls that a problem?
-Yeah.

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:26.991
Should've shot him when l had the chance.

00:20:27.092 --> 00:20:28.320
Big Barney Ross.

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:30.490
Bigger Trench mouse.

00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:33.789
-What are you doing? Praying for work?
-Could be.

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:35.196
Have you been sick?

00:20:35.667 --> 00:20:37.760
-You've lost weight.
-Really?

00:20:37.869 --> 00:20:40.269
Whatever weight l lost, you found, pal.

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:44.372
You guys aren't gonna start sucking
each other's dicks, are you?

00:20:49.815 --> 00:20:52.943
Let's get down to business,
see who wants the work.

00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:54.416
You ever hear of an island called Vilena?

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:56.110
-No.
-Yeah.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.584
lt's a little island in the Gulf.

00:20:59.691 --> 00:21:00.680
That's right.

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:03.459
-You should read more.
-Thanks.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:08.299
There are resources on that island
that my people are very interested in.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.297
But a general by the name of Garza
has overthrown the half-ass government.

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:13.837
That's right.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.070
My people are having a problem
with this fanatic Garza.

00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:19.740
-So you want Garza gone?
-l want him dead.

00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:21.403
All it takes is a little army.

00:21:21.513 --> 00:21:22.878
Only an idiot would do this job.

00:21:23.582 --> 00:21:25.641
-How much?
-Oh, like l said.

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:31.650
l'm busy anyway,
so give this job to my friend here.

00:21:31.757 --> 00:21:33.190
He loves playing in the jungle.

00:21:33.392 --> 00:21:34.723
-Right?
-Right.

00:21:34.926 --> 00:21:38.054
-That's right.
-Hey, why don't we have dinner?

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:39.488
Sure. When?

00:21:39.831 --> 00:21:41.822
-ln a thousand years.
-Too soon.

00:21:45.037 --> 00:21:47.631
-What's his fucking problem?
-He wants to be president.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.175
l got to recon this island first.

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:54.939
l'll have a contact for you on the island.

00:21:57.449 --> 00:21:58.416
Good riddance.

00:21:59.384 --> 00:22:01.409
l got a feeling everyone else
has passed on this job,

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.613
so our fee is $5 mil.

00:22:04.289 --> 00:22:06.587
-$5 mil?
-And l want half upfront,

00:22:06.692 --> 00:22:08.182
and the other half in an offshore account.

00:22:08.293 --> 00:22:10.887
-You got a problem with that?
-No.

00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:16.531
What l have a problem with
is people who try to fuck me over.

00:22:18.704 --> 00:22:21.764
So if you take this money
and you don't deliver,

00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:26.841
or you try to fuck me in some kind of weird
cockamamie scheme of yours,

00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:29.207
me and my people

00:22:29.948 --> 00:22:32.576
are gonna come get you and your people

00:22:33.051 --> 00:22:37.579
and chop you up
into little fucking dog treats.

00:22:39.324 --> 00:22:40.450
You got a problem with that?

00:22:46.832 --> 00:22:47.856
Let's talk.

00:23:18.163 --> 00:23:19.323
Vilena.

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:21.498
Yeah, Vilena.

00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:24.497
They got work there?

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:31.436
Come on.

00:23:32.144 --> 00:23:33.668
You know you shouldn't be here, Gunner.

00:23:34.045 --> 00:23:35.637
Don't replace me.

00:23:36.948 --> 00:23:37.972
l'm good.

00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:41.241
l'm still good.

00:23:41.987 --> 00:23:43.318
You're still using.

00:23:43.488 --> 00:23:45.046
l can't trust you anymore, man.

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:49.089
-You can't trust me?
-l can't.

00:23:52.964 --> 00:23:54.659
You can't trust me?

00:24:03.508 --> 00:24:04.770
Be careful.

00:24:04.876 --> 00:24:06.309
You threatening me, Gunner?

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:10.946
Nah, l'm a nice guy.

00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:22.723
So, going over the info
this guy Church gave me,

00:24:22.828 --> 00:24:25.661
there's probably about
6,000 people on the island.

00:24:25.997 --> 00:24:27.123
How many soldiers?

00:24:27.365 --> 00:24:28.627
Maybe a couple of hundred.

00:24:30.268 --> 00:24:32.736
lt wouldn't take much more than that
to control a space that small.

00:24:32.838 --> 00:24:34.829
Great, they've got a small army.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:35.929
What do we got?

00:24:36.041 --> 00:24:37.065
Four and a half men.

00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:40.311
Not so funny.

00:24:41.079 --> 00:24:42.376
-l need a raise.
-Why?

00:24:42.481 --> 00:24:44.039
l need more money for my son.

00:24:44.382 --> 00:24:45.974
l want to send him to a better school.

00:24:46.218 --> 00:24:48.345
-When did Yin Yang get a family?
-l have no idea.

00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:50.284
You don't ask, l don't tell.

00:24:50.922 --> 00:24:53.686
Anyway, the pay share stays the same.

00:24:54.659 --> 00:24:55.887
That's the way it's gonna be.

00:24:55.994 --> 00:24:58.326
Now the target on this island
is a guy named General Garza.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:01.428
-What's the problem?
-Who gives a shit what the problem is?

00:25:01.967 --> 00:25:04.265
We got enough problems
right here of our own.

00:25:04.369 --> 00:25:07.304
We don't get rid of those first,
they're gonna get rid of us.

00:25:07.772 --> 00:25:10.468
Toll Road, when was
the last time you saw your analyst?

00:25:12.844 --> 00:25:14.573
-This morning.
-Yeah? What'd you talk about?

00:25:17.682 --> 00:25:19.809
Avoidant personality disorder.

00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:20.975
You think too much.

00:25:21.086 --> 00:25:23.850
You know, Toll Road,
you're an unusual guy,

00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:26.949
and you're always gonna have
unusual problems, right?

00:25:27.292 --> 00:25:29.760
Unusual? You're talking about my ear.

00:25:30.795 --> 00:25:32.285
Come on. Don't start with the ear again.

00:25:32.397 --> 00:25:33.523
-Not the ear story.
-The ear story, not again.

00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:35.623
-We all know the ear story.
-We don't want to hear the ear story.

00:25:35.734 --> 00:25:36.792
Let's just concentrate on the job.

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:39.462
No. Shit no. You guys started this.

00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:42.535
-We all know l wrestled in college.
-Right.

00:25:42.641 --> 00:25:47.135
A common injury associated with that sport
is trauma to the ear, a clot.

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:50.873
Which, if left unattended,
causes a contraction in the cartilage

00:25:51.116 --> 00:25:53.107
and forms cauliflower ears.

00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:56.051
-And your point is?
-lt ain't easy being green.

00:25:58.924 --> 00:26:01.916
Anyway, me and Christmas
are gonna head down to Vilena

00:26:02.027 --> 00:26:04.120
and scout the island
to see if we should take the job.

00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:06.891
How much we get paid?
l need more money for my family.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.998
-What family?
-My family.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.251
Listen, that girl wasn't your type.

00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:31.917
Her loss, right?

00:26:32.023 --> 00:26:33.923
l should have broke that bastard's jaw.

00:26:34.125 --> 00:26:35.820
Maybe you were lucky.
He could have broke yours.

00:26:35.927 --> 00:26:39.556
-lmpossible.
-You know, Christmas, l understand,

00:26:39.664 --> 00:26:42.792
but let's just say you were with her
for a couple of hours,

00:26:42.901 --> 00:26:44.664
and it's nice, and it's hot and heavy,

00:26:44.769 --> 00:26:46.760
but after that, think about it.

00:26:46.871 --> 00:26:48.736
What do you do for the rest of the day?

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.703
She probably did you a favor.

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:53.403
Now you have more time
to feel sorry for yourself.

00:26:54.713 --> 00:26:56.010
You're a bleak bastard.

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:03.072
Morning. Morning.

00:28:06.251 --> 00:28:07.980
Morning! Speak English?

00:28:10.655 --> 00:28:11.679
Big plane, huh?

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.423
Yeah, we use it to transport
injured animals.

00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:17.995
-Why are you here?
-Ornithologists.

00:28:18.096 --> 00:28:20.530
We're photographing exotic birds.

00:28:33.111 --> 00:28:34.169
You're nervous?

00:28:34.512 --> 00:28:35.740
Nervous?

00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:38.811
No. Why?

00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:40.878
You just look nervous.

00:28:41.619 --> 00:28:43.246
l'm not nervous. Do l look nervous?

00:28:43.354 --> 00:28:44.582
Your skin looks a little dry.

00:28:44.689 --> 00:28:46.281
l think you should fly
with the window closed.

00:28:46.925 --> 00:28:50.190
-lt's the altitude.
-lt is the altitude. lt'll get to you.

00:29:16.221 --> 00:29:18.985
-What's the address?
-Yeah, it's in my head.

00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:21.021
Do you wanna share it?

00:29:21.526 --> 00:29:23.426
lt's the Gloria Cantina.

00:29:23.528 --> 00:29:26.429
So actually, Cantina Gloria in Spanish.

00:29:27.198 --> 00:29:29.359
Spanish. Who are you, Zorro?

00:29:30.902 --> 00:29:32.301
Army.

00:29:32.403 --> 00:29:33.665
-Shit.
-Come on.

00:29:33.772 --> 00:29:35.000
ln there.

00:29:53.324 --> 00:29:54.313
You rolling?

00:29:54.592 --> 00:29:55.581
Yeah.

00:29:58.396 --> 00:29:59.988
You, you, move the truck!

00:30:04.869 --> 00:30:06.427
Get the suit. Tighten up on the suit.

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:07.732
Got him.

00:30:14.712 --> 00:30:17.408
Look at these clowns,
hand-picked monkeys.

00:30:27.926 --> 00:30:29.052
What's wrong with this picture?

00:30:31.796 --> 00:30:33.127
Everything.

00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:35.225
Let's get out of here.

00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:37.798
No, that's the point, you know.

00:30:37.902 --> 00:30:40.462
You think you know someone,
and you truly do not.

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:43.564
Aren't you the guy who said,
''The man who best gets along with women

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:46.109
''is the man who can
get along without them''?

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:48.076
-That's bullshit.
-Truthfully, she wasn't your type.

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:50.545
-Well, l wasn't finished.
-Look, enjoy your freedom.

00:30:50.648 --> 00:30:53.811
-Yeah, you wait till it happens to you.
-lt has.

00:31:00.158 --> 00:31:01.125
Contact's late.

00:31:01.626 --> 00:31:03.150
All right, let's go.

00:31:03.895 --> 00:31:05.021
Chill.

00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:16.938
Have you ever been rejected?

00:31:22.013 --> 00:31:25.005
You're really pushing the boundaries
of our relationship, you know that?

00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:41.759
-ls that the contact?
-Could be.

00:31:44.769 --> 00:31:46.168
Too bad she's so homely.

00:31:46.271 --> 00:31:47.533
Stay focused.

00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:51.933
Are you the contact?

00:31:52.043 --> 00:31:53.533
l'm Sandra.

00:31:54.045 --> 00:31:55.103
What are your names?

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.075
Buda, Pest.

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:02.712
Follow me, please.

00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:09.650
Buda and Pest? Nice.

00:32:21.339 --> 00:32:23.432
Did you do all these?

00:32:24.542 --> 00:32:26.874
Yes. Take one.

00:32:27.545 --> 00:32:28.603
A gift.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.111
l don't take free gifts.

00:32:32.183 --> 00:32:33.844
-How much you want for it?
-Nothing.

00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:35.886
Taking money for something is not a gift.

00:32:36.454 --> 00:32:38.718
Taking nothing for something is.

00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:40.685
ls it like this all the time?

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:43.390
This place was a beautiful place.

00:32:44.362 --> 00:32:48.298
Then one day, they came with money,
and General Garza sold his soul.

00:32:48.399 --> 00:32:50.026
And people who fight back are killed.

00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:51.632
You said ''they'' came with money.

00:32:51.736 --> 00:32:52.703
Who's ''they''?

00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:54.567
Some Americans. That's all l know.

00:32:55.206 --> 00:32:57.538
But someday all of this will change back.

00:32:59.143 --> 00:33:00.110
You really believe that?

00:33:00.211 --> 00:33:01.508
Yes.

00:33:01.746 --> 00:33:04.010
The best day will be
the one when we can say

00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:06.208
our lives are our own again.

00:33:11.055 --> 00:33:12.283
You have a family, Sandra?

00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:15.489
My mother, when l was little, she died.

00:33:15.593 --> 00:33:18.494
And my father, he's gone, too.

00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:21.695
Sandra, how close
can you get to the palace?

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:23.596
The palace? Why?

00:33:24.102 --> 00:33:26.332
We just wanna check out the view.

00:33:26.804 --> 00:33:27.930
There is no view.

00:33:28.039 --> 00:33:29.631
Why don't we just go there anyway, okay?

00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:45.417
Where is my grove?

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:48.792
Where is your manpower?

00:33:53.564 --> 00:33:56.692
Do you know how long it takes
for a coca field to produce?

00:33:57.068 --> 00:33:58.433
Of course you don't. Let me tell you.

00:33:58.803 --> 00:34:00.737
We are eight weeks behind schedule.

00:34:01.139 --> 00:34:04.302
Kick your peasants' asses.
Get me my product.

00:34:04.575 --> 00:34:08.636
When you talk like this to me
in front of my men, it's no good.

00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:12.541
l am your lifeline.

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:15.216
l am the one who coordinates
all this confusion.

00:34:15.853 --> 00:34:17.684
l am making you rich.

00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:19.780
And being wealthy is very good.

00:34:19.891 --> 00:34:23.884
lt allows people to be the real asswipes
nature intended them to be.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:33.030
Sometimes things
are just not worth the money.

00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:34.805
Sure they are.

00:34:50.688 --> 00:34:51.655
Sandra, are we close?

00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:53.149
lt's just over there.

00:34:53.524 --> 00:34:54.889
Pull over, please.

00:35:01.532 --> 00:35:04.296
-Where are you going?
-Where am l going?

00:35:05.002 --> 00:35:07.129
Well, l suppose you could say

00:35:07.238 --> 00:35:09.968
l like to look at the world
from different views.

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:13.599
Don't lose my hat.

00:35:17.748 --> 00:35:18.874
We should get going.

00:35:19.617 --> 00:35:21.107
He's very emotional.

00:36:01.726 --> 00:36:03.694
What are you looking for?

00:36:07.198 --> 00:36:10.725
Sandra, how do l know
you're not setting us up?

00:36:11.435 --> 00:36:13.369
What does ''setting us up'' mean?

00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:15.769
You don't look like the kind of person
that we deal with all the time.

00:36:15.873 --> 00:36:18.000
How did you get involved in this?

00:36:18.242 --> 00:36:20.005
An American came here.

00:36:20.111 --> 00:36:24.138
He asked my friend to show you around.
He was afraid, so he asked me to.

00:36:24.282 --> 00:36:25.249
And you're not afraid?

00:36:25.483 --> 00:36:26.916
l'm afraid.

00:36:27.251 --> 00:36:29.446
But he said maybe you can help Vilena.

00:36:30.054 --> 00:36:31.646
l don't think so.

00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:34.387
Listen, if l were you, l'd leave.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.891
Just leave.

00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:45.994
You should leave.

00:36:53.844 --> 00:36:55.573
Don't say anything. Let me talk.

00:37:29.146 --> 00:37:30.170
Run!

00:37:55.706 --> 00:37:57.367
-Get her.
-Got it.

00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:12.450
Are you crazy?

00:38:12.657 --> 00:38:14.648
-You could have killed me!
-You're welcome.

00:38:19.597 --> 00:38:20.564
What?

00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:25.763
All right, speed it up. We're on the way.

00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:32.142
lf we get out of here, it's a miracle.

00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:35.809
-She's coming with us, right?
-She'd better.

00:38:38.683 --> 00:38:40.173
-How can we leave?
-We got a plane.

00:38:40.284 --> 00:38:42.582
-No, l can't leave.
-Yeah, well, you don't have a choice.

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.754
-Yes, l do.
-Yeah? They'll find you in an hour.

00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:47.549
-Maybe, but l'm staying.
-Staying for what? There's nothing here.

00:38:47.825 --> 00:38:49.053
Not to you.

00:38:51.896 --> 00:38:53.989
Look, if you stay, then you're dead.
She's leaving with us.

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:44.374
-l got the guys inside.
-Give me a 60-second lead.

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:46.140
-You got it. Go, go, go!
-Come on.

00:40:02.967 --> 00:40:03.934
Get in.

00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:06.258
-Get in.
-No.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:07.667
-Get in.
-No, no, l can't.

00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:09.801
-Let's go.
-l can't. l belong here.

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.805
-There's no time.
-Go, you go.

00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:13.771
Please, go.

00:40:13.878 --> 00:40:14.867
Shit.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:33.622
Hey!

00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:36.600
You look nervous.

00:41:02.193 --> 00:41:03.319
Come on!

00:41:18.275 --> 00:41:19.469
Run, you bastard!

00:41:23.581 --> 00:41:24.775
Come on!

00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:12.162
-Where's the girl?
-Gone. She wouldn't leave.

00:42:12.263 --> 00:42:13.753
Wouldn't leave?

00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:15.789
Why the hell would anybody wanna stay?

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.541
The hell.. .

00:42:29.847 --> 00:42:31.246
The hell with it.

00:42:31.348 --> 00:42:33.908
-Climb, baby, climb.
-Come on, baby.

00:42:45.896 --> 00:42:46.863
God damn it.

00:42:55.372 --> 00:42:56.737
-Going back?
-Yeah.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.865
-Fry and die.
-Fry and die. Let's do it.

00:44:11.715 --> 00:44:13.444
What are they doing?

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:33.527
Yes!

00:44:45.282 --> 00:44:46.408
Great job.

00:44:47.484 --> 00:44:48.576
That was a statement.

00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:10.666
How did two obvious professionals
pass right through security personnel,

00:45:10.774 --> 00:45:13.140
kill 41 soldiers and get away?

00:45:14.378 --> 00:45:16.005
With help, that's how.

00:45:16.647 --> 00:45:19.844
Everything's under control,
except one detail,

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:23.386
a daughter who wants her father
and company dead and gone.

00:45:23.487 --> 00:45:25.045
Bad Shakespeare.

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:28.319
Somehow the company parasites got to her.

00:45:28.459 --> 00:45:30.120
Look, she's your daughter, and that's tragic.

00:45:31.895 --> 00:45:33.954
But blood or not, she goes.

00:45:35.065 --> 00:45:36.794
Call it the price of doing business.

00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:39.330
You don't kill your familia.

00:45:40.003 --> 00:45:42.767
Come around my house
during the holidays, pal.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.022
Nice bird.

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:06.426
First of all, l don't feel comfortable

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:09.055
talking business with a giant
carrying a shotgun.

00:46:09.633 --> 00:46:10.930
Pretty boy wouldn't give it up.

00:46:11.368 --> 00:46:12.630
Not if you wanna know where they are.

00:46:12.936 --> 00:46:14.028
What do you know?

00:46:14.438 --> 00:46:15.405
l used to be one of them.

00:46:20.177 --> 00:46:21.144
Why are you turning on them?

00:46:21.245 --> 00:46:22.269
Lovers' quarrel.

00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:24.914
We settle on 50.

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:26.275
No, math whizz.

00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:29.514
We settle on 100 grand,
upfront, in my pocket.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.981
The guy thinks he's a real badass.

00:46:32.422 --> 00:46:34.014
This geezer's a bloody joke.

00:46:34.424 --> 00:46:35.857
Life's a joke, shitbird!

00:46:37.661 --> 00:46:39.959
lf you don't want that Fu Manchu
knocked back into the '60s,

00:46:40.063 --> 00:46:43.555
you'd better keep your gum-chewing trap
shut and show some respect!

00:46:44.201 --> 00:46:45.293
Bring it.

00:46:45.402 --> 00:46:46.630
Hey, be nice.

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:49.336
Need a facelift, pretty boy?

00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:53.076
Back off, Paine.

00:46:53.177 --> 00:46:54.201
l'm gonna kill him.

00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:55.676
We need him.

00:46:57.447 --> 00:46:58.675
Back off!

00:47:03.854 --> 00:47:05.412
Here's what l think is happening.

00:47:05.522 --> 00:47:08.855
This guy who calls himself Church
is really a front for the ClA.

00:47:09.259 --> 00:47:11.193
So we're working for the agency?

00:47:11.295 --> 00:47:13.729
Yeah.
Church hired us to take out the General,

00:47:13.831 --> 00:47:16.732
but the real target's this guy,
James Munroe.

00:47:18.769 --> 00:47:21.101
He used to be with the agency,
but got greedy,

00:47:21.205 --> 00:47:22.763
went rogue and teamed up with the General

00:47:22.873 --> 00:47:24.932
to keep the whole drug operation
for themselves.

00:47:25.042 --> 00:47:27.067
And that's a big cash loss.

00:47:27.177 --> 00:47:30.169
But Church and the agency
can't afford to send in the Navy SEALs

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.942
or the Special Forces
to take out one of their own.

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:36.213
That'd be a bad headline,
so they hire us to kill him.

00:47:37.321 --> 00:47:38.913
And they're back in business.

00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:42.082
-And we're taken out.
-Nobody's gonna miss us.

00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:44.790
-ls it still $5 million?
-You'd never live to spend it.

00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:47.386
l'm telling Church the deal's off.

00:47:47.898 --> 00:47:49.559
Sound about right?

00:47:49.666 --> 00:47:50.724
That's about right.

00:47:50.834 --> 00:47:51.823
l agree.

00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:18.592
Where is he?

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:34.573
-Who the hell is that?
-Some punk.

00:48:34.978 --> 00:48:37.412
-Don't worry about it.
-We got your back.

00:48:37.514 --> 00:48:40.347
lf he comes over here, we'll bust his ass.

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:48.218
What do you want?

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:50.754
Your life.

00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:52.854
l was thinking about taking it.

00:48:52.963 --> 00:48:54.089
ls that right?

00:48:54.197 --> 00:48:58.224
But l don't do so well in tight spaces,
so going to prison worries me.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:00.830
You shouldn't have bruised her face.

00:49:00.938 --> 00:49:01.905
Really?

00:49:02.072 --> 00:49:03.869
l would have liked to have kept it
the way it was.

00:49:03.974 --> 00:49:05.771
Keep the bitch, 'cause l'm done with it.

00:49:37.507 --> 00:49:38.474
Lee.

00:49:44.181 --> 00:49:47.878
Next time, l'll deflate all your balls, friend.

00:49:57.828 --> 00:50:00.262
Now you know what l do for a living.

00:50:00.831 --> 00:50:02.799
l'm not perfect, but you should have waited.

00:50:04.334 --> 00:50:06.029
l was worth it.

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:08.557
So your daughter paints, too?

00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:12.228
This is how it starts!

00:51:12.602 --> 00:51:14.035
Let's go. There's nothing here.

00:51:14.137 --> 00:51:16.435
Or how it ends!

00:51:44.734 --> 00:51:47.760
What's the matter, Barney?
Don't you ever sleep?

00:51:47.871 --> 00:51:49.771
No. What happened to your girlfriend?

00:51:50.373 --> 00:51:52.967
Another one bites the dust, brother.

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:58.279
l was gonna paint this for her,
and you know what? l'm gonna finish it.

00:51:58.682 --> 00:52:00.980
Then l'm just gonna smash the shit
out of it.

00:52:01.084 --> 00:52:02.449
You wanna be alone?

00:52:04.087 --> 00:52:06.146
Not really. So, what's up?

00:52:06.556 --> 00:52:08.615
On this island, there was this girl.

00:52:08.725 --> 00:52:10.818
There usually are.

00:52:10.927 --> 00:52:15.626
You know, she showed us around.
She was the target's daughter.

00:52:17.467 --> 00:52:21.426
And when she had a chance to leave,
she didn't do it.

00:52:22.672 --> 00:52:24.731
She had some guts.

00:52:26.042 --> 00:52:28.476
Why can't l get that out of my mind?

00:52:30.113 --> 00:52:32.104
You know, she stands for something.

00:52:32.215 --> 00:52:34.274
You know, man, we don't stand for shit.

00:52:34.384 --> 00:52:39.549
We used to, but that dried all up,
like this is gonna dry all up.

00:52:39.656 --> 00:52:41.886
This here paint is gonna dry.

00:52:42.792 --> 00:52:44.225
What dried up?

00:52:46.596 --> 00:52:49.360
Just belief, man. Just the belief in the soul,

00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:52.492
just, l don't know,
the human parts, brother.

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:56.068
You remember that time
we was up in Bosnia?

00:52:56.873 --> 00:53:00.468
We took down them Serb bad boys.

00:53:02.712 --> 00:53:05.943
All our guys were getting chopped up
all around us,

00:53:06.816 --> 00:53:08.613
and there was blood everywhere.

00:53:08.718 --> 00:53:10.447
l never thought l was gonna make it
out of there,

00:53:10.554 --> 00:53:13.489
-and l know you didn't, either.
-Yeah.

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:17.026
Kind of feeling like dead, too, you know?

00:53:17.127 --> 00:53:19.823
My head's all a very black place.

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:21.864
l don't believe in shit.

00:53:22.832 --> 00:53:25.630
Just goddamn Dracula black.

00:53:26.903 --> 00:53:31.533
l remember l got this bottle of the local shit
they have over there, that Slivovitz.

00:53:31.641 --> 00:53:34.769
l don't know,
l think that's what it was called.

00:53:35.579 --> 00:53:37.638
And l ain't feeling no pain now.

00:53:39.249 --> 00:53:40.682
And l'd come up on this.. .

00:53:42.352 --> 00:53:44.912
l'd come up on this old wooden bridge,
and l see this.. .

00:53:51.394 --> 00:53:54.852
l see this woman standing there, you know?
And she's.. .

00:53:56.099 --> 00:53:57.828
l stepped out, and she saw me,

00:53:57.934 --> 00:54:02.496
and she's just looking right in my eyes,
and l was looking right in her eyes.

00:54:04.307 --> 00:54:06.275
l knew what she was gonna do.

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:09.812
She looked at me,
and l knew she was gonna jump.

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.108
You know what l did, man?

00:54:12.215 --> 00:54:17.380
l just turned around and l kept walking,
until l heard that splash.

00:54:21.157 --> 00:54:22.784
Then she was gone.

00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:27.127
And after taking all them lives,

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:32.759
here was one that l could have saved,
but l didn't.

00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:37.804
And what l realized later on was,

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:43.475
if l had saved that woman, l might have,

00:54:45.849 --> 00:54:48.511
l don't know,
saved what was left of my soul, you know?

00:55:32.495 --> 00:55:38.161
A very wise dead man once told me
that a real man never strikes a woman.

00:55:39.235 --> 00:55:43.433
You push some if you have to,
but you never strike them.

00:55:44.974 --> 00:55:46.965
That's the way l was raised.

00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:51.343
This man, however,
does not share that moral dilemma. No.

00:55:52.916 --> 00:55:54.247
This man,

00:55:57.487 --> 00:55:58.749
well.. .

00:55:59.756 --> 00:56:04.716
So the question, Sandra,
why were the Americans here?

00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:56.708
Don't fight back.

00:56:58.348 --> 00:56:59.815
Just relax.

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:33.113
Again, what did the Americans tell you?

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:35.408
Who were they after?

00:57:37.821 --> 00:57:39.220
Continue.

00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:02.942
-l'm going back to Vilena.
-Yeah? Something change?

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.175
-What's the plan?
-There is no plan.

00:58:05.281 --> 00:58:08.842
-Wait, wait, wait. We need a strategy.
-l'm going. You're not.

00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:11.580
-What?
-l said l'm going. You guys aren't.

00:58:11.688 --> 00:58:14.521
-What are you, out of your mind?
-lt's personal business.

00:58:14.624 --> 00:58:17.149
-You don't owe that woman nothing.
-l didn't say l did.

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:19.285
You want to kill yourself? Go ahead, fine.
Your call.

00:58:19.395 --> 00:58:22.387
Listen, l don't want to kill myself.
You guys, take care. l got to do this.

00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:24.399
-Hey, hey, hey.
-What?

00:58:24.501 --> 00:58:26.230
Don't lay this guilt crap on us.
We don't deserve it.

00:58:26.336 --> 00:58:30.830
This is my choice. There's no guilt.
There's no guilt. Take care.

00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:39.344
Yeah, fuck it. His choice. Yeah.

00:58:48.491 --> 00:58:49.583
l said l'm going alone.

00:58:49.692 --> 00:58:50.659
l'm going, too.

00:58:50.894 --> 00:58:52.657
Come on, Yang, get the hell out.

00:58:52.862 --> 00:58:54.295
Just drive.

00:59:03.907 --> 00:59:06.137
Don't lose your nerve.

00:59:07.777 --> 00:59:09.972
Don't talk to me, cockroach.

00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:23.616
So, why are you doing this?

00:59:23.726 --> 00:59:25.387
Friends die together.

00:59:27.196 --> 00:59:29.426
Hey. Give me the good luck ring. Come on.

00:59:30.433 --> 00:59:32.333
Don't make me hurt you, Yang. Come on.

00:59:32.468 --> 00:59:35.528
-Speed better than luck.
-Whatever.

00:59:37.373 --> 00:59:38.362
lt's difficult.

00:59:38.741 --> 00:59:39.730
What is?

00:59:40.209 --> 00:59:42.177
My life is difficult. l need more money.

00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:43.245
Why is that?

00:59:43.346 --> 00:59:45.371
-l work harder than the rest.
-No, you don't.

00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:50.077
Yes, l do. Because they're taller,
everything is harder for me.

00:59:50.186 --> 00:59:54.418
When l get hurt, the wound is bigger
because l'm smaller.

00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:57.188
When l travel, l need to go farther.

00:59:57.293 --> 00:59:58.692
l know, 'cause you're smaller, right?

00:59:59.062 --> 01:00:00.120
Yes.

01:00:02.298 --> 01:00:03.526
My life is harder than you think.

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:09.033
-l need more money.
-l know. You told me.

01:00:09.138 --> 01:00:10.469
For your family, right?

01:00:10.573 --> 01:00:11.801
l don't have family.

01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:12.875
l know.

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:15.772
Maybe one day l will.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.308
Down!

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.964
-Get out there!
-Why me?

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:47.474
Because you're smaller.

01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:07.590
Do that again, l'll kill you!

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:44.759
Gunner!

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:51.166
Come on, Gunner.

01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:54.373
Man's good.

01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:29.602
What are you doing? You're dead, junkie!

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:37.012
lnsect.

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:51.891
Bail!

01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:01.971
Shit!

01:03:30.873 --> 01:03:31.897
Yang!

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:42.785
What do you wear, size three?
Bring it, happy feet.

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:49.782
My turn!

01:04:58.261 --> 01:04:59.250
Gunner!

01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:07.896
Shit!

01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:37.264
You shot me.

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:40.902
Hey, don't say that.
You were gonna kill him.

01:05:41.637 --> 01:05:43.468
l was just gonna scare him.

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:46.037
Don't put that on me. You never liked him.

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:50.578
Am l dying?

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:52.944
The shot's a couple of inches
above your heart.

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:57.719
l'll take that as a yes.

01:06:00.856 --> 01:06:04.121
Gunner, who sent you? Who hired you?

01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:06.926
Who cares?

01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:08.496
Do yourself a favor.

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:13.928
Don't go out a total asshole.
Cooperate for once in your miserable life.

01:06:14.937 --> 01:06:16.768
Then bury me right.

01:06:16.872 --> 01:06:18.305
You got it.

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:22.810
Who sent you? Who sent you?
ls the girl still alive?

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:24.310
Come closer.

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:44.957
You know, it's not easy being your friend.

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:46.828
That's true.

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:49.404
Man, we'll die with you.
Just don't ask us to do it twice.

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:52.407
l know the layout.
l'll tell you about it on the way.

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:55.234
What the hell happened to you?

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:57.039
lt's too sad to talk about it.

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:01.846
Let's fly.

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:22.602
You know, the enemy's
always been terrified of noise,

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:24.434
especially shotguns.

01:07:25.908 --> 01:07:28.468
With this big boy spitting out
250 rounds a minute,

01:07:28.577 --> 01:07:30.238
you tell me who's tolerating that.

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:35.012
Absolutely zero.

01:07:35.684 --> 01:07:39.518
So let me get this right.
Gunner tries to kill you, you shoot him

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:41.613
and, at death's door,
he gives you the whole layout?

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:43.055
Yeah, something like that.

01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:45.855
-l would have win.
-l know you would have win.

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:51.766
You know what? l trust you.

01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:54.732
l want you to meet my girlfriend.

01:07:55.704 --> 01:07:58.502
Omya Kaboom.

01:07:58.607 --> 01:08:00.097
You lost me there.

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:02.837
When Omya's prime is struck,

01:08:02.945 --> 01:08:06.312
she gets off a miniature warhead
that arms itself.

01:08:07.116 --> 01:08:10.051
And when that happens,
anything that gets in my lady's way

01:08:10.152 --> 01:08:12.814
becomes instant red sauce and Jell-O.

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:14.150
And if that doesn't work,

01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:20.290
her sister will.

01:08:20.396 --> 01:08:21.829
You should meet my doctor.

01:08:21.931 --> 01:08:23.228
Too late.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:52.051
lt's 3:36. We have 20 minutes
to take this place down.

01:09:52.154 --> 01:09:53.985
l'll take the cellar.

01:09:54.089 --> 01:09:55.317
We've got company.

01:09:56.559 --> 01:09:57.924
l got him. You guys take off.

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:29.018
ls there a reason you've taken
the soldiers this man has trained

01:10:29.124 --> 01:10:31.490
and made them look like fools?

01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:34.624
They look like warriors.

01:10:38.934 --> 01:10:41.232
Warriors loyal to me.

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:46.632
l thought the people of Vilena
hired these mercenaries to kill me.

01:10:48.043 --> 01:10:52.537
But then l think maybe this is your plan,
because you cannot control me.

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:56.082
And torturing Sandra works for you.

01:10:56.952 --> 01:10:59.785
You want to kill her to make me suffer.

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:04.387
A man can never kill a child.

01:11:05.694 --> 01:11:07.025
But you can.

01:11:07.129 --> 01:11:08.994
Bring Sandra here.

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:13.925
Bring her now or l will kill you.

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:15.367
Go get her.

01:14:19.354 --> 01:14:22.050
-No, no.
-Sandra, Sandra, it's me. Sandra.

01:14:22.157 --> 01:14:25.490
Hey, it's me, it's me. Sandra, it's me.

01:14:26.228 --> 01:14:29.026
lt's me. lt's me. lt's okay.

01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:32.498
Nobody's gonna hurt you, all right?

01:14:32.601 --> 01:14:33.898
How are you here?

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:35.559
l just am.

01:14:37.372 --> 01:14:39.397
-Can you move?
-Yes.

01:14:39.508 --> 01:14:40.975
Okay.

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:43.340
Yeah, okay. All right, let's go.

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:48.305
Time's up.

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:49.714
-Where's Barney?
-What's the call?

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:50.785
We can't find him in 10 minutes,

01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:51.853
we're going out the same way we came in.

01:14:51.954 --> 01:14:53.251
-No way.
-That's what he'd want.

01:14:53.355 --> 01:14:55.380
Ten minutes! Let's go.

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:24.208
No. Stop him!

01:15:25.387 --> 01:15:27.412
-This is not his fight. lt's mine.
-Get her out of here.

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:29.479
Seal the building.

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:32.453
Stand him up.

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:39.126
You know,
if you didn't have this Kevlar vest,

01:15:39.234 --> 01:15:41.464
your insides are gonna be
like fucking mush.

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:42.662
Well, ain't that sad?

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:43.931
You know, you're a lucky man.

01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:45.506
You're the lucky man.

01:15:45.607 --> 01:15:47.973
No, no, you're a lucky man.

01:15:48.677 --> 01:15:51.009
-He told me to keep you conscious.
-Did he?

01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:54.340
All right.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.644
You're a real tough guy, aren't you?

01:15:59.755 --> 01:16:02.189
-What?
-Are you a real tough guy?

01:16:02.824 --> 01:16:04.655
Look at me, you piece of trash.

01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:06.317
How many men you got?

01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:08.020
Just your mother.

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:23.009
Now this is your last time.

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:26.672
You give me the right answer,
and l'll cut you a break.

01:16:28.617 --> 01:16:31.677
lf you give me the wrong answer,
you will die a damn slow death.

01:16:31.787 --> 01:16:33.345
Do you understand me?

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:35.218
-Do you understand me?
-Yep.

01:16:35.324 --> 01:16:38.088
-Who sent you?
-Can't breathe.

01:16:38.193 --> 01:16:39.854
Loosen up.

01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:41.857
Who sent you?

01:16:44.399 --> 01:16:46.390
Your hairdresser.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.594
Go, we gotta go!

01:19:20.555 --> 01:19:22.284
Come on.

01:19:45.881 --> 01:19:46.973
Shit!

01:20:08.603 --> 01:20:10.002
Remember this shit at Christmas!

01:20:13.675 --> 01:20:14.664
Damn, that thing's loud.

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:17.301
-What happened to you?
-l got my ass kicked.

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:21.575
Come on. Get my rifle. Let's go.

01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:29.882
What's this?

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:35.190
Everything bad that has happened,
you bring.

01:20:35.297 --> 01:20:36.855
Take your money!

01:20:37.966 --> 01:20:41.060
l only see death with you. Take it all and go.

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:42.429
l'm not going anywhere.

01:20:42.537 --> 01:20:43.765
You are done here.

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:45.134
You can't succeed without me.

01:20:45.373 --> 01:20:46.704
l am the leader.

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:48.332
You're a puppet in a hat.

01:20:49.945 --> 01:20:51.003
No.

01:21:09.898 --> 01:21:11.092
Now!

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:15.199
Get back.

01:21:24.112 --> 01:21:25.704
Throw down your weapons.

01:21:27.148 --> 01:21:28.638
There's no way out.

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:32.853
Shit's getting old!

01:21:33.221 --> 01:21:35.382
-Your lucky ring stinks.
-l know.

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:37.449
-Let's backtrack.
-The building's rigged.

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:39.550
lt's the only way out.

01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:51.500
Chopper's ready in five minutes.

01:21:51.606 --> 01:21:52.595
We're not leaving yet.

01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:05.050
-What's he saying?
-He said we're dead with an accent.

01:22:05.153 --> 01:22:06.484
We ain't dead.

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:08.351
-Blow the building.
-Not yet.

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:12.051
We will kill this American disease.

01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:30.941
Blow the building!

01:22:31.046 --> 01:22:32.240
She's still in there!

01:22:32.347 --> 01:22:33.814
The money!

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.114
Blow it!

01:22:44.592 --> 01:22:45.854
Blow it!

01:22:52.033 --> 01:22:54.934
She's out. Blow the fucking building!

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:46.346
l'm out!

01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:41.795
Let's go. Come on.

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:44.327
Cut Munroe off!

01:26:44.499 --> 01:26:45.557
Come on!

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:28.363
Hey!

01:28:28.469 --> 01:28:29.902
-Thing's too heavy.
-Give me it.

01:28:30.004 --> 01:28:32.666
-What do you want me to do?
-Throw it as hard as you can.

01:28:58.733 --> 01:29:00.530
-Blow the dump.
-Got it!

01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:33.889
Munroe!

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:39.271
Drop the weapons,
or l'll put a bullet through her eye.

01:29:41.576 --> 01:29:42.770
Don't test me.

01:29:53.688 --> 01:29:55.212
No, no, no.

01:29:55.323 --> 01:29:57.621
Shut up or l'll kill you.

01:29:59.594 --> 01:30:02.722
The agency parasites hired you,
didn't they?

01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:06.630
l'd have paid you twice as much
to go fishing.

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:09.430
You'd have to think
l'm pretty freaking stupid

01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:11.266
to surrender to the agency.

01:30:11.372 --> 01:30:16.105
Why would l do that? l created this.
l made it all happen.

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:20.807
And then they wanted me out. Why?
Because l saw the big picture.

01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:22.875
Stop walking.

01:30:24.752 --> 01:30:28.711
And what about me and you?
We're both the same.

01:30:28.823 --> 01:30:32.919
We're both mercenaries.
We're both dead inside.

01:30:33.327 --> 01:30:35.352
So why the hell did you come after me?

01:30:35.463 --> 01:30:38.899
l didn't come after you, dipshit.
l came for her!

01:30:58.152 --> 01:30:59.813
-You okay?
-Yeah.

01:31:00.655 --> 01:31:02.282
Call it a tie.

01:31:04.859 --> 01:31:06.121
Yeah, l guess so.

01:31:06.561 --> 01:31:08.893
You know, you're not as fast as you think.

01:31:08.996 --> 01:31:11.123
l'm beginning to sense that.

01:31:23.945 --> 01:31:27.972
The second account number's mine.
lt'll help get things going around here.

01:31:28.082 --> 01:31:30.380
No, l can't. You've done so much.

01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:34.683
Yeah, well, so have you. A gift for a gift.
You take it.

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:39.216
-Will you come back?
-l promise l'll always be around.

01:31:48.302 --> 01:31:49.826
You take care, Sandra.

01:31:52.773 --> 01:31:53.831
You take care.

01:31:59.947 --> 01:32:01.073
Bye.

01:32:28.175 --> 01:32:29.142
What?

01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:30.777
Truthfully?

01:32:31.112 --> 01:32:32.340
Yeah?

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.745
l never really thought she was your type.

01:32:59.807 --> 01:33:01.672
All right, baby. All right.

01:33:01.776 --> 01:33:03.107
Come on, let's see what you got.

01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:07.042
That's my boy!

01:33:11.819 --> 01:33:12.945
Go south!

01:33:18.492 --> 01:33:20.517
You lost! You lost!

01:33:24.231 --> 01:33:26.665
So you're back from the dead.
How you healing?

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:30.704
Good, considering
you could have killed me.

01:33:30.838 --> 01:33:32.362
l forgive you.

01:33:32.673 --> 01:33:33.901
Okay.

01:33:34.442 --> 01:33:36.069
l would have win.

01:33:36.177 --> 01:33:37.838
Of course.

01:33:39.947 --> 01:33:40.936
Hey, Gunner.

01:33:41.682 --> 01:33:44.674
Whatever doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, brother. Therapy.

01:33:46.087 --> 01:33:47.315
Man's got a point.

01:33:51.592 --> 01:33:52.650
You know what?

01:33:53.194 --> 01:33:54.889
l'm gonna do you a favor, Tool.

01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:58.762
''l once knew a man called Tool.. .' '

01:33:58.866 --> 01:34:00.595
l love poetry.

01:34:01.035 --> 01:34:04.402
''To me, was the epitome of cool

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:07.202
''He was good with a knife

01:34:10.344 --> 01:34:12.005
''Bad with a wife.. .' '

01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:14.169
That hurts.

01:34:14.281 --> 01:34:16.476
''But to think he could beat me

01:34:17.618 --> 01:34:20.712
''Dreaming he'd defeat me

01:34:22.456 --> 01:34:23.753
''Cool Tool

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:27.157
''You gotta be a fool''

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:32.898
Oh, yeah.
